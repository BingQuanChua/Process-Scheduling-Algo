# process-scheduling-algo
Process scheduling is the basis for multi-programmed operating systems. This program demonstrates the simulation of CPU scheduling algorithms by generating useful results.

This was a TC01 Operating System Assignment.



<h2>
    CPU Process Sceduling Algorithms
</h2>

Featured Algorithms:

1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)

2. Non Preemptive Shortest Job First

3. Preemptive Priority

4. Round Robin

<h2>
  Running the program
</h2>

Run **ProcessScedulingAlgorithm.jar**.



<h2>
    Instructions
</h2>

1. Select a scheduling algorithm from the drop-down list.
2. Enter the Arrival Time, Burst Time and Priority (optional for some algorithms) for all the processes. You may click 'Add' or 'Remove' to change the number of processes.
3. Click 'Calculate'. 
   (for Round Robin Scheduling, a dialog box will pop up to prompt the value of Time Quantum)
4. The program will generate all of the results. 
   You may select a new algorithm and click 'Calculate' to generate a new set of results or just simply click 'Reset' to clear all the previously entered data.
